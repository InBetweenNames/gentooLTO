LTOize is a set of configuration files and overrides to make building your system Link Time Optimization easy.  This is part of a bigger initiative to find errors in C and C++ programs that are caused by undefined behaviour.  Users are strongly encouraged to contribute their configuration changes upstream.  For more information, see the gentooLTO project on GitHub.
