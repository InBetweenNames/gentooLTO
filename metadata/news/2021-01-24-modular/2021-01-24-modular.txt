Greetings and happy new year!

GentooLTO is undergoing some changes to become more modular and suitable for a wider range of systems.
As of today, the `ltoworkarounds.conf` file has been split across multiple separate files that
are installed in package.cflags instead with the latest `sys-config/ltoize`.
They are named after their corresponding section from the previous `ltoworkarounds.conf` file.
Eventually, these files will disappear entirely and be managed similar to the LTO patching functionality
within GentooLTO with the aim of preventing files from being installed into /etc/portage entirely.

Users upgrading may experience some breaking changes under certain scenarios:
 * You have a .conf within package.cflags whose name conflicts with one of the GentooLTO .conf files
 * You have changes to ltoworkarounds.conf that have not been upstreamed

In these cases, you will need to run etc-update to resolve the conflicts.

For backwards compatibility, I am keeping the original ltoworkarounds.conf present for a week
so that users not ready to migrate to the new system can stay at ltoize-0.9.7.  No PRs will be 
accepted to the original ltoworkarounds.conf, however, and it will disappear after this.

More to come soon!
