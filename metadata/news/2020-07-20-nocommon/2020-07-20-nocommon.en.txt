Hello again everyone,

GentooLTO is now officially on GCC 10.  If you're still on an older compiler and don't intend to upgrade,
make sure you enable `USE=keep-nocommon` on `sys-config/ltoize` to ensure that you still have the `-fno-common`
overrides on your system.  They have been moved to a separate file called `nocommon.conf`, which is not installed
unless that `USE` is set.
