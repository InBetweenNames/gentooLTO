#FLTO should be of the form -flto[=n] where n is the number of threads to use during linking.
#It's usually a good idea to set this to the number of hardware threads in your system

# Keep all static libraries unstripped.
# This should allow you to omit almost all -ffat-lto-objects flags and build many more packages with LTO.
# After enabling this you must rebuild all packages providing static libraries with LTO support.
# Use $ `equery b -n $(find /lib* /usr/lib* -type f -name "*.a" 2>/dev/null)` | sort | uniq
# or # `emerge -1va $(find /lib* /usr/lib* -type f -name "*.a" 2>/dev/null)` commands to get corresponding list.

#GRAPHITE contains Graphite specific optimizations and other optimizations that are disabled at O3

#These should be updated with GCC 7.2.1 (-ftree-loop-distribution may be enabled
#by -O3 by default)

#FLTO and GRAPHITE are variables used in the LTO and Graphite overrides as well.  If you don't want Graphite or LTO,
#just unset these variables--no further action is necessary.  Don't rename these variables as the overrides depend on them.

#Your CFLAGS should contain ${FLTO} and, depending on your gcc, -fuse-linker-plugin
#Newer GCCs enable -fuse-linker-plugin by default.
#${GRAPHITE} should be included here as well.  If you do not want Graphite, just unset the GRAPHITE variable and keep CFLAGS the same.
#It will be easier for you to experiment that way.

#Your LDFLAGS should contain *ALL* of your CFLAGS for LTO to work.  It must receieve all optimization options, march, etc.
#It's usually a good idea to enable -Wl,--hash-style=gnu as well to help find packages which don't respect LDFLAGS
#NEW: package.cflags takes care of this for you--no need to manually add your {C,CXX}FLAGS here.
#Your profile likely contains a -Wl,-O1 in there--that could potentially conflict with LTO settings, so we remove it here.

#Consider also using cpuid2cpuflags to set your CPU_FLAGS_* variable in your make.conf for packages that rely on explicit optimizations such as intrinsics
