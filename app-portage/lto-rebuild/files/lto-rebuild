Usage: lto-rebuild [OPTION]

lto-rebuild can be used to avoid a full system rebuild after upgrading GCC
when using GentooLTO. It searches in /usr/lib, /usr/lib32, and /usr/lib64
on your system for all installed static archives that were built using
a different GCC than the current one.

Note: make sure your system is as up to date as possible before doing this.
If an installed package does not have a corresponding ebuild available,
this command will fail. You can use -l to manually intervene.

Options:

-h	Display this help
-a	Only list the archives that were built with other GCC versions
-l	Only list the packages that would be rebuilt (and their slots)
-r	Rebuild the packages using emerge (will ask for confirmation)
